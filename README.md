# Object-Relations
Explanation of how objects used routinely create memory and how the contents within them are to create tendencies and behaviors to increase learning and productivity

PERCEPT CONNECT aims to create understanding of how the occupation of space by objects in our personal, private, and social environments create confusion and roadblocks encountered in tasking as they are used wasteful and irrationally.

Object interaction begins soon after birth as shapes figures and colors are provided to child to begin association between live and static image.

Interaction between child and world was altered as images in pan are began to be used to condition sound and not view as the primary sense of attention span.

Interaction was thus enhanced from conceptual tactile learning by adding images and sound to reinforce the hand eye cordination provided by the toy.

Computer was introduced as a creative tool to type responses and create images conceived in imganation to images and roles of introduced by parenting, play and tele-sensing

Computer was also imperative in the reduction of error in economic and civil processess 

Smartphone was created to produce behavior and network sequences in response to learning being more conceived out of tele-visual sources 

 Technology is implemented to enhance learning methods in situations that are encountered most frequently
 
  ie: For children under the age of 5 most frequent situation is eat & play children love to play but not to eat. (This observation of learning increment leads to energy handling sequences of Percept Connect)
  
 Purpose at this point is to create learning capacity by understanding how human energy works as child rests to cope with learning experience
 
 From 5-13 the traditional form of learning takes a secondary role as the sensory value of electronic (see, hear) learning is much more intense than the tactile (touch, see) 
 
At this point lack of understanding from the previous stage of ascension can result in learning and productive disorder as writing becomes the main practice and not type

Emotional capacity at this point allows for child to obtain relation by communicating common concerns to classmates. Child begins to create emotional progression from emotions instilled by parents provoked by object learning and televisual role interpretation

At this point body language and physical composure provides explanation to how child is coping with the expansion of the self

Smartphone use at this point is of interest for market research as American Psychological Association creates new discoveries and technology continues to innovate.

At the stage of 14-18 teens use their phones to begin network relations based on trait similarities and opportunities to locate experiences to expand knowledge acquired

After teen years the person or character in progression is labeled based on the accumulation of trait sequences gathered from all learning experiences.
    (SEE Line 64 of Pure Science VS Applied Science Repository)
    
After teen years when productivity becomes crucial, individual must learn control choice which is the halt in horizontal thought sequence by implementing contralateral perception which is the opportunity to speak about an observation or realization made through content subscription or study sequence.     

FOR PERCEPT CONNECT PROGRAMMING PURPOSES: It is imperitive to keep track of learning sequences as they vary throughout learning experiences to create network solutions for the different personalities and trait sequences & characteristics.

Understanding learning sequences allows for easier data interpretation and for the ability to perceive through the relations or differences which the data provides.

This ability allows mobile and solutions to be anticipated as they become of need to people with slower learning curve and for potential global opportunities. 

ANALOGOUS or DELAYED LEARNING EXPERIENCES: Academic or traditional learning, physical education or practice, S-Experiment, Auditory Non Visual such as Music & Podcasts

ELECTRONIC: Computer, smartphone, TV, Video games

FOR PERCEPT CONNECT NETWORK AND TRANSPORT SOLUTIONS: Content composure while en route to learning or networking experiences creates observatory experiences which allow for unconscious memory to be in use for geographical manuevering while conscious and working memory keeps aware (Bus or Train) or drives and tunes to content 

                                              Interprtation of New-Ton's 
                                              Laws of Motion and Travel
                                              
LAW NUMBER ONE: An object at rest stays at rest. In-ter-rest begins to change as emotions are provoked by external feelings.   An object in motion stays in motion. An object in motion is one with pre-disposed causes or ancestrial dis-positions. Alteration happens at speed or pace and cause rates or number of intersections to vary depending on emotional capacity to be utulized at destination.

LAW NUMBER TWO: Force acts while acceleration results. When net force is applied the object accelerates.

Force = Content Sequence & topic

Content is energy which provides advocacy for trait, ability or chracteristic in need of increase for further population awareness and consciousness

Content network sequence creates in-stances that are to be learned by population as tendencies and behaviors as energy travels through the network to create new population parameters.

Acceleration results = "WHY?" which is purpose to stand, sit, or being in motion.

LAW NUMBER THREE: The law of action and reaction begins after an intersection or gathering upon EI use or emotional investment which creates consequences that produce reactions and responses when all parties involved arrive at separate spaces to continue neural progression.

INTERPRETATION OF COMMON BEHAVIORS WITHIN USE OF OBJECTS: As we interact with the objects which we use to shape and condition our physical state, irrationality or the concern of error and lack of control lead create a negative use of thought which leads to the corrosion of memory as we fail to link the purpose or motive of use each continious use. 

The goal at PERCEPT CONNECT is to understand how the relation between the use of common behaviors (Common due to most population being capable to do them) such as walking, standing, seating, and laying down relate to the objects which accomodate them.

To create new tendencies out common behaviors their continious and repetitive use must be linked logically to the context, purpose and use of rationale as they progress each day 

Standing concerns the foot and uses the sneaker, shoe, heel or boot to show the purpose and communicate the reason why the user is standing 

Laying concerns rest and the before and after of how the user became tired

Seating concerns the expansion of thought through rest type write read or watch and allows the person to perceive imagine the past, present or future 

Walking concerns the linking of two noding stations that the person must travel between to acquire relief (bathroom) and replenish energy (eat, drink) it also provides a halt in occupation for a new tenency to be created to enable variance that could further extend seating perception

While common behaviors are in use physical extension and explanation of reason & purpose is possible through perception (sight & ear) reactions (hand eye cordination) and responses (voice)
